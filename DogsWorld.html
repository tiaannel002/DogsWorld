        Willow is 13 years old and she is a Siberian Husky. She has been in the family since I was in 
        grade 4. She has a beautiful black and white coat and also amazing shades. Believe it or not, 
        but her favorite toy is an empty 2L bottle. Not many people know this about Siberian Huskies, 
        but they have 2 coats of hair. One for winter and one for summer, so when it is summer, she 
        actually sheds her hair. That way her body is adjusting to the heat. She never bites, she only
        likes to give out kisses to anybody who come and visit. She will always be my special girl and
        best friend.
